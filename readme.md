# The real-time human pose estimation, powered by YOLOv8 with the webcam 

This project is dedicated to applying computer vision to deliver a dependable and efficient solution for human pose recognition specifically focusing on measuring the walking speed of cardiac surgery patients in the rehabilitation dorm.

## Requirements
First, we use PyTorch(CPU)
see more on the PyTorch site: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

```Python
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```
Then, we need to install an Ultralytics for the YOLOv8 pose estimation

```Python
pip install ultralytics
```

## Context
